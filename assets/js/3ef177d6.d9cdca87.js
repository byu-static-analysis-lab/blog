Essentially the common questions that we ask is about what values can flow to which points in the program. Due to infinite loops, and arbitrary run-time input, we cannot just interpret the program while logging all values of each variable. Instead we really want to know all possible ways the program can execute given ",(0,n.jsx)(s.em,{children:"any"})," input or path through the program. This is a very difficult problem, and in general is undecidable. However, there are many cases where we can get a good approximation of the answer, and that is what we are interested in.

For the solution to be ",(0,n.jsx)(s.em,{children:"sound"})," it means that we need to consider all possible executions of the program. Because it is an approximation we can either underestimate all possible executions (leaving out some possibilities) or overestimate all possible executions (including some possibilities that are in reality not possible). We are interested in the latter case, because we want to be sure that we are not missing any possible execution paths. If we don't consider all possible executions that could mean that our analysis is ",(0,n.jsx)(s.em,{children:"unsound"}),", for example it might say that a value is always positive, when in reality it could be negative.
