More generally, if you have some way to combine api calls that can reduce overhead of some kind, can we find an automated way to do so? However, the paper relies on two broad techniques to solve this: program transformations and (database-aware) compiler optimizations, both of which I see problems with."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(a.p,{children:"While, generally speaking, program transformations may be alright, I feel that those presented in the paper, such as the loop fission technique that is at the core of almost everything they discuss, are very invasive. They would end up producing code that is difficult to read and maintain (especially if multiple devs implement separate loop fissions, leading to nested loops). The authors themselves point out that this is especially a problem when dealing with queries made in nested procedures. (On the topic of nested procedures, they don't describe the full technique, but instead refer to an earlier paper, which I am curious to read)."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(a.p,{children:"Compiler optimizations are also risky because they make implicit a very important aspect of the program, the algorithms that determine its speed. If these techniques are not universally (or nearly universally) applicable, it would be easy for an inexperienced developer to make a change that causes a serious performance regression without ever realizing. Why am I worried about this and not other compiler optimizations? My ideas are not fully formed on this yet, but I think one aspect is just how important things like network latency are to the performance of an application."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(a.p,{children:"So an ideal technique for me would be one that leaves the code mostly intact as the developer wrote it (which, hopefully, would mean it would be more readable and maintainable), but which also has an explicit reference at some point to how the optimization is taking place.
