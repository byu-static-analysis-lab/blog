# Is m-CFA a good representation
- Hash-flow analysis says in section 6:
Work by Might, Smaragdakis and Van Horn [20] discusses the relationship between static analysis of higher-order functions and objects. It turns out that encoding closures (flatly) as objects sacrifices opportunities for precision, since is strictly contracts the abstract state-space. Analyzing closures directly allows for a nested abstraction that better separates individual bindings to variables.
